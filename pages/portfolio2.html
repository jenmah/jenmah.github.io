  <h3 class="portfolio-h3">Look Book</h3>
  <p>The client I was working with was a hair stylist wanting to create a look book of styles she felt comfortable with for her customers to be able to flip through for inspiration.</p>

  <p>Having had no previous design work done for her, we worked together to build up her brand, picking a palette and font combinations which later carried into other projects.</p>
